# MockAPI Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the MockAPI project. Tasks are organized by category and priority.

## Code Quality Improvements

1. [x] Implement proper logging throughout the application
   - [x] Replace System.out.println and System.err.println with SLF4J or Log4j
   - [x] Add appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - [x] Include contextual information in log messages

2. [ ] Address all TODO comments in the codebase
   - [ ] Move constants in DynamicEndpointRegistrar to a separate constants class
   - [ ] Implement better endpoint extraction in DynamicRequestHandler
   - [ ] Add validation for invalid IDs in DynamicRequestHandler
   - [ ] Complete implementation of POST, PUT, and DELETE methods in DynamicRequestHandler
   - [ ] Extract the nextInternalId generator in DataGeneratorService to a separate method

3. [ ] Improve error handling
   - [ ] Add proper exception handling in ConfigFileParser
   - [ ] Implement consistent null handling (avoid returning null)
   - [ ] Create custom exceptions for different error scenarios
   - [ ] Add proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

4. [ ] Fix code style and naming issues
   - [ ] Correct method name "generatedMockData" to "generateMockData" in DataGeneratorService
   - [ ] Remove fully qualified class names from toString() methods
   - [ ] Ensure consistent code formatting across all files

5. [ ] Improve type handling in DataGeneratorService
   - [ ] Preserve proper data types when generating JSON instead of converting everything to strings

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Improve separation of concerns
   - [ ] Split ConfigFileParser into separate classes for file loading and JSON parsing
   - [ ] Reduce coupling between DataGeneratorService and GeneratedDataRepository

2. [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
   - [ ] Use constructor injection consistently throughout the codebase
   - [ ] Avoid field injection with @Autowired on fields

3. [ ] Add configuration validation
   - [ ] Validate JSON configuration files against a schema
   - [ ] Add runtime validation of configuration properties

4. [ ] Improve module organization
   - [ ] Review and refine module dependencies
   - [ ] Ensure each module has a single, well-defined responsibility

## Documentation Improvements

1. [ ] Enhance code documentation
   - [ ] Add missing Javadoc comments to all public methods
   - [ ] Improve existing documentation with more details and examples

2. [ ] Create project documentation
   - [ ] Add README.md with project overview and setup instructions
   - [ ] Create architecture documentation with diagrams
   - [ ] Document API endpoints and usage examples

3. [ ] Add configuration documentation
   - [ ] Document all configuration options
   - [ ] Provide example configuration files

## Testing Improvements

1. [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests
   - [ ] Add tests for all service classes
   - [ ] Add tests for utility classes
